Let's Chat!
===================

I just started this project because I was getting a little rusty and decided that I would create an small solution to the problem we have on the workplace.

There is a lack of comunication between the workforce and is due the tools used here. Currently there are tools like sametime from IBM that allow only IBM employees to use it, creating a wall between people from IBM and those from other companies.

This solution aims to fill this hole and is currently in development. You can access this tool from this link:

This chat was build with the whole-she-bang:

 - MongoDB
 - Express
 - MVC with vanilla javascript
 - Node
 - socket.io

As you can see from the **package.json** it contains a set of different tools that helps this app to achieve it's goal.
